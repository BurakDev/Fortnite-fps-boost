# Fortnite fps boost

Hey skids of the internet come skid me thnx

* For some power shell scripts you have to run this command Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

run the bat file first then the scripts then put the TimerResolutionService some where on your pc

To create the service open CMD as admin then type in sc.exe create FPSBoost binPath= "Where ever it is" start= auto

Then it will start it on your pc launch this can give you anywhere from a 40 to 100 fps boost improvement the worse pc seems to be the better it runs ngl bye thnx
